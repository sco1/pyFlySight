; IMU settings

; NOTE: Configuring away from default IMU values currently
;       requires installation of beta firmware, which can be

; NOTE: Currently not possible to achieve full logging rate
;       for the accelerometer and gyro; current max is ~1666 Hz

; NOTE: Defaults are as of time of writing & may change based
